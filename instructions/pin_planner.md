this represent all the pins available in your FPGA board.
in the down side, you can see your inputs and outputs.
you can choose the pin you want to associate your input, output with.

for instance, in the picture shown above, `PIN_H2` is associated with the reset input, when you activate it in your FPGA board, reset value will be activated too.
